# IntroToAI_Project1
kNN algorithm for supervised learning, and genetic algorithm for function approximation, and simulated annealing algorithm for function approximation

The kNN algorithm is at the root level of the project, while the genetic algorithm is in the 'partB' directory.

The simulated annealing algorithm is in the 'partB/simulated_annealing' subdirectory.

No touch ups to the project have yet been done, so the code may require a few small edits (to path variables and such) to get it to work. 

See "project1_assignment_details.pdf" for the requirements of the project. 

See "ProjectOneReport_JordanWhite.pdf" for my written report summarizing my findings.
